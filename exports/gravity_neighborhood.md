# Gravity Neighborhood Seed

Integrator functions identified: 18
Integrators with at least one caller: 1

| Integrator | Caller | VertHits | SpatialHits | Shifts |
|------------|--------|---------:|------------:|-------:|
| FUN_00040a98 | FUN_0001f218 | 0 | 3 | 0 |

## Prioritization

High-priority candidates are callers with spatial_hits>0 and shifts>0; these may bridge higher-level logic to integrator core.
