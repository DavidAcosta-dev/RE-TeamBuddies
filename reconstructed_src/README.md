# Reconstructed Source Catalogue

Store clean-room reimplementations of verified Team Buddies routines here.

## Guidelines

- Structure by subsystem (`engine/`, `ai/`, `physics/`, etc.) using additional subdirectories.
- Begin each file with a comment documenting the original binary offsets, supporting tracer output, and dependencies.
- Prefer modern C/C++ or C# translations that can be imported into Unity prototypes.
- Add unit or integration tests alongside new modules where possible.
- Update the workspace inventory after adding or modifying reconstructed sources.
