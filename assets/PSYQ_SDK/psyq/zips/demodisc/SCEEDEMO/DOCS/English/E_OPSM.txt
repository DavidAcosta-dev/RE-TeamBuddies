Summary of OPSM demo disc publication

SCEE maintains a Special Projects department which produces all the demo discs cover-mounted
on Official PlayStation Magazine (OPSM) titles throughout the PAL territories.

Special Projects is separate from the 3rd Party Relations group, and does not have any
dealings with publishers' own demo discs (these are stand-alone or multiple demo discs with
SLED product codes).

Here is an overview of the OPSM family of cover-mount demo discs produced by
SCEE Special Projects.

Official PlayStation Magazine Cover Discs
Future/Euro (distributed in UK, Italy, Spain, Russia, Australia, Greece, Norway, Benelux)
	Official PlayStation Magazine	13 issues per year
Future Special Editions (UK only)
	Essential PlayStation	4 issues per year
	OPSM Special (Racing, Football, etc.)	3 issues per year
Germany (distributed in Germany, Austria and Switzerland)
	Offizielle PlayStation Magazin	12 issues per year
	OPSM Spezial (Strategie, RPG, etc)	6 issues per year
France
	Officiale PlayStation Magazine	11 issues per year

The total production of OPSM demo discs is over 1,350,000 units per month.

The UK is the largest single territory with a print run of 550,000 per issue.
The disc produced for the UK is also supplied to other countries such as Greece,
Italy and Spain.

Separate demo discs are produced for France and Germany.

It costs nothing for a publisher's demo to be featured in these discs, but,
a publisher's demo can only be used if it has been coded and submitted to the correct
specification (Technical Specification for European Demo Disc Segments).

Scheduling demo production
This information pack includes a monthly schedule of deadline dates for demos to be
submitted for OPSM cover discs. This will allow you to judge when your demo will be released
relative to your game's retail release.
The time required to produce a demo segment can obviously vary depending on the nature of the
game code, so we advise developers to plan at least a week into their production schedule.
Careful attention to the technical specification for demos, and the TRC requirements, will benefit
your work by reducing easily avoidable bugs.

1999 Schedule
Please note: The month listed is the month of publication of the OPSM.
In the UK and Germany, magazines are published in the month preceding their cover date.
The monthly deadline is roughly 14 weeks prior to publication of the magazine carrying
the cover disc. The deadline is the day we start building the first disc of the month.
These schedules are subject to ammendation.
