IT GETS MIGHTY DARK AND DANGEROUS UP HERE IN THE MOUNTAINS...

YOUR RIVALS CONSTRUCTED A SERIES OF LANTERNS TO LIGHT THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS DARK AND TREACHEROUS VALLEY. ONCE THROUGH THEY PUT THEM OUT SO THAT THEY COULDN'T BE FOLLOWED AND STATIONED SENTRIES TO PATROL THE AREA AND GUARD THE LANTERNS. 

SWITCH THE LANTERNS BACK ON, AND DECIMATE THE ENEMY SO THEY DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

INCOM TIPS:

SOME OF THE LANTERNS HAVE BEEN PLACED IN AWKWARD AREAS. YOU MAY NEED TO GET AIRBORNE TO REACH THEM.
