THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A SOJOURN IN THE MOUNTAINS TO REINVIGORATE A BUNCH OF HARD FIGHTIN' BUDDIE SOLDIERS. THE CLEAN AIR, THE CLEAR SKIES, THE SOUND OF HEAVY GUN FIRE... AHHH, WHAT BETTER PLACE FOR AN ALL-OUT PUNCH UP? AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE ENEMY HAS HAD THE SAME IDEA! 

YOU'VE LANDED AT THE AIRPORT TO FIND THE MOUNTAINS CRAWLING WITH ENEMY TEAMS. THEY'RE SECURING THE AIRPORT AND SURROUNDING AREAS. FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH THEIR RANKS AND FIND OUT THE LOCATION OF THE SECRET FACTORY - USE ALL UNNECESSARY FORCE.

INCOM TIPS:

A NUMBER OF SWITCHES HAVE BEEN SPOTTED NEAR THE ENEMY BASES, THEY MAY HELP TO LOCATE A HIDDEN PLANE.

WATCH OUT FOR THE YETI!
