THE ENEMY TEAM HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SCIENTIST'S WORK ON MECHANOLOGY AND ARE CLOSE TO REACHING OPERATIONAL STATUS. INCOM. INFORMS US THAT THERE IS A MECH PROTOTYPE FACTORY LOCATED HIGH IN THE ANCIENT ORIENTAL MOUNTAINS. THE COMPLETION OF THIS LETHAL NEW TECHNOLOGY WOULD SURELY MEAN YOUR DEMISE. FLY UP THERE, SEEK OUT THE FACTORY AND DESTROY IT. 

NEW BUDDIE TYPE RECRUITED: 

BIO-TECH HAVE ISOLATED A NEW SUPER GENE AND IMPLANTED IT INTO SOME OF THE NEW RECRUITS. THE SUPER BUDDIE IS ROCK HARD. THEY CAN WITHSTAND EVEN MORE DAMAGE THAN THE CYBORG AND CAN DISH IT OUT WITH LASER EYES. FLYING ISN'T PERFECT AND ONLY GLIDING CAN BE ACHIEVED INITIALLY. UPGRADE A SUPER BUDDIE THOUGH AND THE SKIES THE LIMIT. PRESS AND HOLD THE JUMP BUTTON TO GET AIRBORNE. 

THE ONLY DRAW BACK IS THEY WILL NOT USE WEAPONRY OR DRIVE VEHICLES AS THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES TOO DAMN DOUBLE TOUGH HARD.
