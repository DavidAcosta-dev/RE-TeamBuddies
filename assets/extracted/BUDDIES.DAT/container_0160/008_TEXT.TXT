THE ENEMY ARE FRUSTRATED WITH YOUR GOOD DEEDS SPOILING THEIR EVIL PLANS. THEY'VE HIRED A CONTRACT KILLER TO PUT A STOP TO YOUR MEDDLING - PERIOD. 

THE RONG BROS. ARE THE MOST FEARED MARKSBUDDIES IN THE BUSINESS AND ARE KNOWN FOR TAKING OUT THEIR TARGETS IN FLY-BY BOMBING RAIDS. INCOM INFORMS US THAT THEY PLAN TO HIT US WHERE IT HURTS AND GO FOR OUR 5 STAR GENERALS ON THEIR WAY HOME ON THE NIGHT BUS. USUALLY THESE HARDENED VETERANS WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES, BUT THEY'VE BEEN ON THE FIZZY POP AND DON'T QUITE REALISE WHAT'S GOING ON. 

KEEP THE BOMBS AWAY FROM THE BUS AND THE GENERALS UNTIL THEY ARE ALL SAFE.

YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN FOR THIS ONE - GOOD LUCK!

INCOM TIPS:

THE R & D BOYS ARE TRYING TO GET ANOTHER PLANE OUT TO YOU AS SOON AS THEY'VE BUILT IT.
