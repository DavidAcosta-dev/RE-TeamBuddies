SHE'S GONNA BLOW! THE IKIMEN ARE NOT A VERY ADVANCED RACE AND HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED SPACE TRAVEL. AN INTERGALACTIC PORTHOLE HAS OPENED WHICH WILL ZAP THEM BACK TO BUDDIE WORLD TO JOIN IN THE JIVING AND FUNKY RYTHMNS GOING ON DOWN THERE. 

THE PORTHOLE CAN ONLY TRANSPORT ONE ORGANISM AT A TIME AND MUST BE POWERED UP FOR EACH TELEPORT. 

TOUCH 4 POWER BEACONS TO ACTIVATE THE PORTHOLE, AND CARRY AN IKIMAN ONTO THE GLOWING TRANSPORTATION HOT PLATE. 
 
ENSURE THAT THEY MAKE IT OFF THE MOON BEFORE IT ERUPTS INTO A RAGING CUBE OF MOLTEN FURY - IT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.

INCOM TIPS:

THE POOR BUGGERS ARE SCARED STIFF AND WILL NEED STUNNING BEFORE TRYING TO CARRY THEM.

DON'T DROP ANY IKIMEN, THERE IS A LOT OF LAVA AROUND HERE.
