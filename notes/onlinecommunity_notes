Team Buddies (MagDemo37: BUDDIES\BUDDIES.DAT\* and nested *.BND files)

  000h 4     ID "BIND"
  004h 4     Number of files (N)
  008h N*28h File List
  ...  ..    File Data area

File List entries:

  000h 20h   Filename ("\FILENAME.EXT", zeropadded)
  020h 4     File Offset (increasing, 4-byte aligned)     ;\see note
  024h 4     File Size in bytes (always a multiple of 4)  ;/

Note: There is a 4-byte gap between most files, that appears to be caused by weird/bugged alignment handling done as so:

  size=((filesize+3) AND not 3)       ;size entry for curr file (plus 3)
  offs=((filesize+4) AND not 3)+offs  ;offs entry for next file (plus 4 !!!)

Namely, odd filesizes (eg. for TXT files in BUDDIES.DAT\00D2h..00D7h) are forcefully rounded-up to 4 bytes boundary. If that rounding has occurred then there is no additional 4-byte gap (but the 4-byte gap will appear if the original filesize was already 4-byte aligned).
